### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [senior researcher](https://www.mysociety.org/author/alexparsons/) at [mySociety](mysociety.org), working across the climate, transparency and democracy programmes. 

In the past I've worked on renting campaigns, such as [the campaign to end letting fees](/retrospective-on-lettingfees-co-uk/). 

I have an MSc in Democracy and Democratisation, and write about [elections and representation](/category/democracy-voting/).

I'm a [Python developer/data scientist](/code/), and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ajparsons).
